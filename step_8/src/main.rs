    The main.rs is the default entry point of a binary crate.
    This binary crate's name is the same as the project's name.
    In this case, the project's name is "step_8" and this crate's name is "step_8".
    If there are multiple binary crates in a project, it needs to use the --bin flag to specify which binary crate to run.
    Run this crate: cargo run --bin step_8
